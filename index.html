                <h3 class="about-me"><h3 class="intro-title">Little Bits of Background</h3>

                    
                    <p>In grade school, I created images on the computer using lines and pixels. 
                        The teacher asked me what website I got that from, and how I got in onto the computer.
                        Oh, the frustration. But of course, I cannot be stopped. </p>
                    
                    <p>As a teenager, I attended the Academy of Art University one summer for non-credit classes
                        learning about video game design and 3D modeling. What a fantastic summer.</p>
                    
                    <p>As an adult,
                        I attended Joliet Junior College where I earned my associate in arts. 
                        I then transferred to NIU where I graduated 
                        with a bachelors in nutrition. I changed my major a few times trying to figure out where 
                        the path of greatest success would be.
                        I didn't want to be a starving artist, and my parents were big on 
                        veganism at the time so I thought I would become a nutritionist, since food is medicine. 
                        I realized close to my graduation that I didn’t want to put feeding tubes in people, 
                        or tell people what to eat or how to live their life.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Around that same time, (2017) I started creating art to sell at events for extra money. 
                        I created an etsy shop to reach the online community and started selling my art at events all around America. 
                        Selling art is a valuable source of income, 
                        but it can be unpredictable and unstable.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am looking for 
                        something I can love. I have recently had a lot of time to sit and think. 
                        I remember taking a programming class in highschool and how much I loved it, but being 
                        shied away by it being a male-dominated field. High School was rough, and the last thing 
                        I wanted was to be seen as more “nerdier” than I already felt/was.</p>
                    
                    <p>Present Day - I have been teaching myself front-end development for the last 6 months 
                        through several online courses and personal curiosity. I have done the full dive. 
                        I have gotten lost in a Javascript framework. I have spent many hours finding every 
                        cool thing I can find with CSS. Flexbox, grid, animations.
                        I have been wrestling with Javascript 
                        for a few months, and I feel confident I know the basics. </p> 
                    
                    <p>
                        <br>
